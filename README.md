# Diabetes-Prediction-through-Data-Analysis

About
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a person has diabetes. It uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various health metrics. The goal is to classify a person as either positive or negative for diabetes based on their medical records.

Key Features
Predict diabetes status (positive/negative).

Trained with a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine).

Implements preprocessing of data (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).

Installation
To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install dependencies:
bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing dependencies, open the diabetes_model.py file to see how the model is trained and tested.

Run the script to train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python diabetes_model.py
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data (example provided in predict.py).

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py
Dependencies

Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, available at:

Source: Kaggle

The dataset contains 8 features and 1 target variable:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)

Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg / height in mÂ²)

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that represents the likelihood of diabetes based on family history

Age: Age of the patient

Outcome: Target variable (0 for no diabetes, 1 for diabetes)

Model
The model is built using Scikit-learn's classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine (SVM).

The dataset is split into a training and testing set, and performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Steps:
Load and preprocess the data.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train the model on the training set.

Evaluate the model on the testing set.

Save the trained model for future predictions.
